To this end, we perform nanoscale, all-optical relaxometry with a scanning quantum sensor based on a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in diamond. Magnetic noise is detected through an increase of the spin relaxation rate of the NV defect, which results in an overall reduction of its photoluminescence signal under continuous laser illumination. As a proof-of-concept, the efficiency of the method is demonstrated by imaging various spin textures in synthetic antiferromagnets, including domain walls, spin spirals and antiferromagnetic skyrmions.

We study the effects of introducing increasing thicknesses of Ir, from zero to 2 nm, into a Pt/Co/Ta multilayer between the Co and Ta layers. There is a marked increase in magnetic moment, due to the suppression of the dead layer at the interface with Ta, but the perpendicular anisotropy is hardly affected. All samples show a universal scaling of the field-driven DW velocity across the creep and depinning regimes. Asymmetric bubble expansion shows that DWs in all of the samples have the left-handed Néel form. The value of in-plane magnetic field at which the creep velocity shows a minimum drops markedly on the introduction of Ir, as does the frequency shift of the Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks in Brillouin light scattering (BLS) measurements. Despite this qualitative similarity, there are quantitative differences in the DMI strength given by the two measurements, with BLS often returning higher values. Many features in bubble expansion velocity curves do not fit simple models commonly used, namely a lack of symmetry about the velocity minimum and no difference in velocities at high in-plane fields. These features are explained by the use of a new model in which the depinning field is allowed to vary with in-plane field in a way determined from micromagnetic simulations. This theory shows that the velocity minimum underestimates the DMI field, consistent with BLS giving higher values.

We also study the effects of a curved versus a flat boundary, a second skyrmion, and a nonmagnetic defect. We find that the skyrmion's internal modes play a dominant role in the thermally activated transitions compared to the spin-wave excitations and that the relative contribution of internal modes depends on the nature of the transition process. Our calculations for a small skyrmion stabilized at zero field show that collapse on a defect is the most probable path. In the absence of a defect, the annihilation is largely dominated by escape mechanisms, even though in this case the activation energy is higher than that of collapse processes. Escape through a flat boundary is found more probable than through a curved boundary. The potential source of stability of metastable skyrmions is therefore found not to lie in high activation energies, nor in the dynamics at the transition state, but comes from entropic narrowing in the saddle point region which leads to lowered attempt frequencies. This narrowing effect is found to be primarily associated with the skyrmion's internal modes.","tags":null,"title":"Thermal stability of metastable magnetic skyrmions: Entropic narrowing and significance of internal eigenmodes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R Soucaille","F Garcia-Sanchez","J-V Kim","T Devolder","J-P Adam"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535760000,"objectID":"b39d96ceb4cda3719d46e2ed15771f71","permalink":"/publication/soucaille-2018-bb/","publishdate":"2020-08-01T21:07:35.893331Z","relpermalink":"/publication/soucaille-2018-bb/","section":"publication","summary":"We revisit the description of ferromagnetic domain wall dynamics through an extended one-dimensional model by allowing flexural distortions of the wall during its motion.

However, this reduces the set of variables that describe skyrmion motion. Here we theoretically explore the dynamics of skyrmions and antiskyrmions in ultrathin ferromagnetic films and show that current-induced spin–orbit torques can lead to trochoidal motion and skyrmion–antiskyrmion pair generation, which occurs only for either the skyrmion or antiskyrmion, depending on the symmetry of the underlying Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction. Such dynamics are induced by core deformations, leading to a time-dependent helicity that governs the motion of the skyrmion and antiskyrmion core. We compute the dynamical phase diagram through a combination of atomistic spin simulations, reduced-variable modelling and machine learning algorithms. It predicts how spin–orbit torques can control the type of motion and the possibility to generate skyrmion lattices by antiskyrmion seeding.","tags":["skyrmions","antiskyrmions","spin-orbit torques","atomistic simulations","topsky"],"title":"Trochoidal motion and pair generation in skyrmion and antiskyrmion dynamics under spin–orbit torques","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D Pinna","F Abreu Araujo","J-V Kim","V Cros","D Querlioz","P Bessiere","J Droulez","J Grollier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1527811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527811200,"objectID":"c71d1aa2cc27848f5b9f3847f10d6d50","permalink":"/publication/pinna-2018-gj/","publishdate":"2020-08-01T21:07:35.947025Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pinna-2018-gj/","section":"publication","summary":"The topologically protected magnetic spin configurations known as Skyrmions offer promising applications due to their stability, mobility, and localization.

The primary objective was to establish the utility and feasibility of the nanocontact vortex oscillator, a nanoscale spintronic device, as a universal building block for chaos-based information processing by demonstrating key technological functionalities, such as random number generation and communication using symbolic dynamics. The underlying idea is that the complexity required for computation and possible cognitive functions can be generated within a single system, without the need of a complex array of interconnected subsystems. The project built upon the NOMADE group’s discovery of novel commensurate and chaotic phases in the nanocontact vortex oscillator.\nThe project objectives were defined by three scientific questions related to magnetic vortex dynamics on the nanoscale, namely:\n Can the chaotic state be detected experimentally? How does the chaotic state respond to external forcing? Can the chaotic state be exploited for information processing?  These questions were addressed by combining the use of high-performance simulation tools and quantitative theories with state-of-the-art experiments involving high-frequency electrical characterisation.\nThis project has funded by the Horizon2020 Research Framework Programme of the European Commission under contract no. 751344.\n","date":1517468400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517468400,"objectID":"f49cc0fc2afa82c5ad2f9576f2031b48","permalink":"/project/chaospin/","publishdate":"2018-02-01T09:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/chaospin/","section":"project","summary":"Chaos-based information processing using spintronic nano-oscillators","tags":["chaos","chaospin","nanocontact vortex oscillators","vortex dynamics","vortices","magnetization dynamics","spintronics"],"title":"ChaoSpin","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Topological properties of magnetic skyrmions and opportunities for novel spintronic devices The scientific objectives should allow us to achieve a better control of the generation, the manipulation, the excitation and the detection of ultra-small skyrmions in magnetic multilayer systems.

To harness these traits for next-generation spintronics, the nanoscale control and imaging capabilities that are now routine for ferromagnets must be developed for antiferromagnetic systems. Here, using a non-invasive, scanning single-spin magnetometer based on a nitrogen–vacancy defect in diamond, we demonstrate real-space visualization of non-collinear antiferromagnetic order in a magnetic thin film at room temperature. We image the spin cycloid of a multiferroic bismuth ferrite (BiFeO$_3$) thin film and extract a period of about 70 nanometres, consistent with values determined by macroscopic diffraction. In addition, we take advantage of the magnetoelectric coupling present in BiFeO$_3$ to manipulate the cycloid propagation direction by an electric field. Besides highlighting the potential of nitrogen–vacancy magnetometry for imaging complex antiferromagnetic orders at the nanoscale, these results demonstrate how BiFeO$_3$ can be used in the design of reconfigurable nanoscale spin textures.","tags":null,"title":"Real-space imaging of non-collinear antiferromagnetic order with a single-spin magnetometer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R L Stamps","J-V Kim","F Garcia-Sanchez","P Borys","G Gubbiotti","Y Li","R E Camley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504224000,"objectID":"c6529b430b1d2a381549e5188d961211","permalink":"/publication/stamps-2017-cs/","publishdate":"2020-08-02T18:28:14.465022Z","relpermalink":"/publication/stamps-2017-cs/","section":"publication","summary":"This chapter discusses the propagation of spin waves along domain walls and consequences of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) on their dispersion.

This is confirmed by an analytical calculation which shows that spin-torques have no effect on the Arrhenius escape rate associated with thermally activated domain wall depinning in this geometry.

The magnetization and exchange stiffness constant of the CoFeB free layer are thereby found to be substantially reduced compared to the corresponding thin-film values.

One outstanding issue concerns the non-adiabatic spin-torque component $β$, which has an important role in wall dynamics, but no clear consensus has yet emerged over its origin or magnitude. Here, we report an experimental measurement of $β$ in perpendicularly magnetized films with narrow domain walls (1–10 nm). By studying thermally activated wall depinning, we deduce $β$ from the variation of the Arrhenius transition rate with applied currents. Surprisingly, we find $β$ to be small and relatively insensitive to the wall width, which stands in contrast to predictions from transport theories. In addition, we find $β$ to be close to the Gilbert damping constant $α$, which, in light of similar results on planar anisotropy systems, suggests a universal origin for the non-adiabatic torque.","tags":null,"title":"Non-adiabatic spin-torques in narrow magnetic domain walls","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J-V Kim","C Burrowes"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1259625600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1259625600,"objectID":"90f70d5fe1ce03d6f215746e06cb1565","permalink":"/publication/kim-2009-hq/","publishdate":"2020-08-01T21:07:36.010718Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kim-2009-hq/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a theoretical study of the influence of magnetic viscosity on current-driven domain wall dynamics.

Bit selection and fast direct overwrite can be obtained by superimposing another field pulse along the easy magnetisation axis.
