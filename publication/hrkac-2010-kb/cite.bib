 abstract = {We present a numerical study of oscillation modes in magnetic tunnel junction nanopillars and investigate the frequency and the full width at half maximum of the power spectrum as a function of applied field and applied current. We show that the line width reaches a minimum of 14.5 MHz as the system approaches the threshold current, and increases sharply to 308 MHz as the current is increased beyond the threshold current. The initial line narrowing is due to an increased coherence in the uniform precession mode, while the line broadening above threshold arises from the intrinsic oscillator nonlinearity combined with overlapping contributions from edge modes. We show that these results are in good agreement with recent experiments on MgO-based oscillators.},
