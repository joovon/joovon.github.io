 abstract = {We characterize spin-wave propagation and its modification by an electrical current in permalloy($\mathrmPy$)/$\mathrmPt$ bilayers with $\mathrmPy$ thickness between 4 and 20 nm. First, we analyze the frequency nonreciprocity of surface spin waves and extract from it the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction constant $D_s$ accounting for an additional contribution due to asymmetric surface anisotropies. Second, we measure the spin-wave relaxation rate and deduce from it the $\mathrmPy$/$\mathrmPt$ spin-mixing conductance $g_\mathrmeff^\ensuremathp̆arrow\ensuremath↓$. Last, applying a dc electrical current, we extract the spin Hall conductivity $\ensuremathσ_\mathrmSH$ from the change of spin-wave relaxation rate due to the spin Hall spin-transfer torque. We obtain a consistent picture of the spin-wave propagation data for different film thicknesses using a single set of parameters $D_s=0.25$ pJ/m, $g_\mathrmeff^\ensuremath\ărrow\ensuremath↓=3.2ıfmmode\times\else×\fi10^19\phantomůle0.2em0ex\mathrmm^\ensuremath-2$ and $\ensuremathσ_\mathrmSH=4ıfmmode\times\else×\fi10^5$ S/m.},
