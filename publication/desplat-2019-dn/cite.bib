 abstract = {We study annihilation mechanisms of small first- and second-order skyrmions and antiskyrmions on the frustrated $J_1 - J_2 - J_3$ square lattice with broken inversion symmetry (Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction). We find that annihilation happens via the injection of the opposite topological charge in the form of meron or antimeron nucleation. Overall, the exchange frustration generates a complex energy landscape with not only many (meta)stable and unstable local energy solutions but also many possible paths connecting them. Whenever possible, we compute the activation energy and attempt frequency for the annihilation of isolated topological defects. In particular, we compare the average lifetime of the antiskyrmion calculated with transition state theory with direct Langevin simulations, for which excellent agreement is obtained.},
