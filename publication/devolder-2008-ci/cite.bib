 abstract = {Using high bandwidth resistance measurements, we study the single-shot response of tunnel junctions subjected to spin torque pulses. After the pulse onset, the switching proceeds by a ns-scale incubation delay during which the resistance is quiet, followed by a 400 ps transition terminated by a large ringing that is damped progressively. While the incubation delay fluctuates significantly, the resistance traces are reproducible once this delay is passed. After switching, the time-resolved resistance traces indicate micromagnetic configurations that are rather spatially coherent.},
