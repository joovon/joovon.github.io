 abstract = {Magnetic vortex dynamics in thin films is characterized by gyrotropic motion, the sense of gyration depending on the vortex core polarity, which reverses when a critical velocity is reached. Although self-sustained vortex oscillations in nanoscale systems are known to be possible, the precise role of core reversal in such dynamics remains unknown. Here we report on an experimental observation of periodic core reversal during self-sustained vortex gyration in a magnetic nanocontact system. By tuning the ratio between the gyration frequency and the rate of core reversal, we show that commensurate phase-locked and incommensurate chaotic states are possible, resulting in Devil\textquoterights staircases with driving currents. These systems could have the potential to serve as tunable nanoscale radiofrequency electrical oscillators for secure communications, allowing schemes such as encryption by chaos on demand.},
