 abstract = {The temperature dependence of the generation linewidth for an auto-oscillator with a nonlinear frequency shift is calculated. It is shown that the frequency nonlinearity creates a finite correlation time $τ=1/Γ_p$ for the phase fluctuations. In the low-temperature limit in which the spectral linewidth is smaller than $Γ_p$, the line shape is approximately Lorentzian and the linewidth is linear in temperature. In the opposite high-temperature limit, in which the linewidth is larger than $Γ_p$, the nonlinearity leads to an apparent “inhomogeneous broadening” of the line, which becomes Gaussian in shape and has a square-root dependence on temperature. The results are illustrated for the spin-torque nano-oscillator.},
