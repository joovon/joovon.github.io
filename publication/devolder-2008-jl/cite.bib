 abstract = {We have measured the distribution of switching times in spin-transfer switching induced by fast current pulses in two pillar-shaped systems: (i) spin valves and (ii) MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions. (i) Spin valves can sustain high currents, such that the application of pulsed currents of amplitude a few times that of the static switching threshold is possible. This makes subnanosecond switching within reach. In that limit, the pulse durations leading to switching follow a multiply stepped distribution at 300K and a regular distribution at 40K. At 300K, this reflects the precessional nature of the switching, which proceeds through a small number of precession cycles. The switching time distribution can be modeled from the thermal variance of the initial magnetization orientations. At 40K, nonuniform magnetization switching occurs. (ii) In MgO-based tunnel junctions, we could follow individual time-resolved switching events with a 13 GHz bandwidth. The switching proceeds through a nanosecond-scale random incubation delay during which the resistance is quiet, followed by a sudden (400 ps duration) transition terminated by a pronounced ringing that is damped within 1.5 ns. While the incubation delay is probabilistic, the following time dependence of the resistance is reproducible.},
