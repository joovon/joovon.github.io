 abstract = {We study the current and temperature dependences of the microwave voltage emission of spin-valve nanopillars subjected to an in-plane magnetic field and a perpendicular-to-plane current. Despite the complex multilayer geometry, clear microwave emission is observed for current densities in the interval of 9×107–13×10$^7$ Acm\textminus2. The emission frequency stays near 12 GHz when I<Ired=11.2×107Acm\textminus2, then redshifts with a slope gradually reaching \textminus350MHz$\slash$mA. The linewidth narrows exponentially to 3.8MHz, then broadens again as the emitted voltage redshifts. The temperature dependence of the linewidth exhibits a curvature change around the linewidth minimum.},
