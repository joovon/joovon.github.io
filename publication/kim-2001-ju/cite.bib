 abstract = {Long-wavelength spin waves are examined in an exchange biased ferromagnet/antiferromagnet bilayer. The frequencies of the excitations are calculated as a function of external field strength and orientation. It is suggested that the angular dependence of the frequencies can lead to linewidth enhancements, in agreement with recent experimental results. It is also shown that the study of the spin wave frequencies can yield the strengths of the antiferromagnet anisotropy and interlayer coupling.},
