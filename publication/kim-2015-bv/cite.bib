 abstract = {The consequences of nonlinear anisotropic damping, driven by the presence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling in thin ferromagnetic metals, are examined for the dynamics of topological magnetic solitons such as domain walls, vortices, and skyrmions. The damping is found to affect Bloch and NÃ©el walls differently in the steady-state regime below Walker breakdown and leads to a monotonic increase in the wall velocity above this transition for large values of the Rashba coefficient. For vortices and skyrmions, a generalization of the damping tensor within the Thiele formalism is presented. It is found that chiral components of the damping affect vortexlike and hedgehoglike skyrmions in different ways, but the dominant effect is an overall increase in the viscouslike damping.},
