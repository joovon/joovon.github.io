 abstract = {We study a spin torque oscillator based on magnetic vortices hosted by a pseudo spin valve, and generated and confined by a nanocontact configuration. In addition to the standard functioning modes of such spin torque oscillators, we present evidence for field and current conditions leading to a novel extinction regime, where the oscillator response is transiently quenched. We model the dynamics analytically for two non-interacting vortices, one in each magnetic layer. The similarity of their trajectories makes them prone to interact. We argue that they can synchronize and then follow identical orbits, which leads to the extinction of the RF voltage emission.},
