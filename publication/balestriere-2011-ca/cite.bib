 abstract = {We study the electrical field induced magnetization reversal in a GaMnAs thin film magnet at the nanosecond scale. Quasi-static electrical fields deplete partially the magnetic material, reducing its magneto-crystalline cubic anisotropy and affecting its transport properties. We demonstrate that electrical field pulses can trigger the nucleation of domains with reversed magnetization. Pulse durations of 2.5 ns are enough to induce the nucleation, indicating precessional effects in the dynamical magnetic response. Full reversal can be obtained with 10 ns and 3 V and the assistance of magnetic fields substantially lower than the coercivity of the material in the absence of gate voltage.},
