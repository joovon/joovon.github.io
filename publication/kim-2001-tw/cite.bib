 abstract = {The influence of local defects in exchange biased ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic bilayers is studied using numerical simulations. The location of defects relative to the interface is found to be the main factor determining the magnitude of coercive and bias field modifications. One consequence is that some types of defects control stability of partial wall structures. This may explain coercivity enhancement as arising from irreversible pinning of partial domain walls in the antiferromagnet.},
