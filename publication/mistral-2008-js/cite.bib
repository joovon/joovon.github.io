 abstract = {We present experimental evidence of subgigahertz spin-transfer oscillations in metallic nanocontacts that are due to the translational motion of a magnetic vortex. The vortex is shown to execute large-amplitude orbital motion outside the contact region. Good agreement with analytical theory and micromagnetics simulations is found.},
