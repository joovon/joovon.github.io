 abstract = {Ultrathin metallic ferromagnets on substrates with strong spin-orbit coupling can exhibit induced chiral interactions of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) form. For systems with perpendicular anisotropy, the presence of DM interactions has important consequences for current-driven domain-wall motion and underpins possible spintronic applications involving skyrmions. We show theoretically how spin textures driven by the DM interaction allow nonreciprocal channeling of spin waves, leading to measurable features in magnetic wires, dots, and domain walls. Our results provide methods for detecting induced DM interactions in metallic multilayers and controlling spin-wave propagation in ultrathin nanostructures.},
