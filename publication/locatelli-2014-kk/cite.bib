 abstract = {Spin torque nanodevices are smart magnetic components for which fast current-induced resistance variations can be obtained thanks to the fine interplay between electronic transport in magnetic multilayers and non-linear magnetization dynamics. By playing with the device dimensions, shape and bias conditions, but keeping the same magnetic stack, it is possible to design and implement a rich variety of functions, such as binary memory, random number generators, microwave oscillators, microwave detectors, spin wave emitters, memristors and more. This versatility combined with almost unlimited endurance, subns dynamics and CMOS compatibility make spin torque nanodevices the ideal building blocks for bio-inspired computing.},
