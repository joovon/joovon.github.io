 abstract = {The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in ultrathin ferromagnets can result in nonreciprocal propagation of spin waves. We examine theoretically how spin wave power flow is influenced by this interaction. We show that the combination of the dipole-dipole and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions can result in unidirectional caustic beams in the Damon-Eshbach geometry. Morever, self-generated interface patterns can also be induced from a point-source excitation.},
