 abstract = {We examine theoretically the role of spin waves on current-induced domain wall dynamics in a ferromagnetic wire. At room temperature, we find that an interaction between the domain wall and the spin waves appears when there is a finite difference between the domain wall velocity $\stackrelıfmmode \dot\else ̇\fix_0$ and the spin current $u$. Three important consequences of this interaction are found. First, spin-wave emission leads to a Landau-type damping of the current-induced domain wall motion toward restoring the solution $\stackrelıfmmode \dot\else \̇\fix_0=u$, where spin angular momentum is perfectly transferred from the conduction electrons to the domain wall. Second, the interaction leads to a modification of the domain wall width and mass, proportional to the kinetic energy of the domain wall. Third, the coupling by the electrical current between the domain wall and the spin waves leads to temperature-dependent effective wall mass.},
