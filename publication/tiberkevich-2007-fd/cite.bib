 abstract = {An expression for the microwave power generated by a spin-torque oscillator in the presence of thermal noise is derived. This expression, when used in a subcritical (I<Ith) regime, demonstrates that generated power is determined by the noise level and provides a simple way to experimentally determine the threshold current Ith for microwave generation. The same expression gives a good quantitative description of the experimentally measured dependence of the generated power on the bias current p(I) in a moderate supercritical (Ith<I<1.5Ith) range of bias current variation.},
