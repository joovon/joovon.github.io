 abstract = {A dynamic coupling between the magnetic layers of a spin-valve structure can result from the exchange of spin currents pumped from the precessing magnetization of each layer. We show theoretically that such dynamic coupling can give rise to an effective damping for the free layer which depends on the spin-valve configuration and is sensitive to the bias field acting on the pinned layer.},
