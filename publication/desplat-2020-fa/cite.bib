 abstract = {We perform a direct comparison between Kramers' method in many dimensions, ie, Langer's theory, adapted to magnetic spin systems, and a path sampling method in the form of forward flux sampling, as a means to compute the collapse rates of metastable magnetic skyrmions. We show that a good agreement is obtained between the two methods. We report variations of the attempt frequency associated with skyrmion collapse by three to four orders of magnitude when varying the applied magnetic field by 5% of the exchange~Å‚dots},
