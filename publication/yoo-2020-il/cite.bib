 abstract = {Harnessing chaos or intrinsic nonlinear behaviours of dynamical systems is a promising avenue toward unconventional information processing technologies. In this light, spintronic devices are promising because of the inherent nonlinearity of magnetization dynamics. Here, we demonstrate experimentally the potential for chaos-based schemes using nanocontact vortex oscillators by unveiling and characterizing their waveform patterns and symbolic dynamics using time-resolved electrical measurements. We dissociate nonlinear deterministic patterns from thermal fluctuations and show that the emergence of chaos results in the unpredictable alternation of well-defined patterns. With phase-space reconstruction techniques, we perform symbolic analyses of the time series and show that the oscillator exhibits maximal entropy and complexity at the centre of its incommensurate region. This suggests that such vortex-based systems are promising nanoscale sources of entropy that could be exploited for information processing.},
