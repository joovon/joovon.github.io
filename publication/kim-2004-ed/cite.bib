 abstract = {We present theoretical results of precession-dominated switching of synthetic antiferromagnet elements. A fast (subnanosecond) reversal mode is shown to be possible for perfectly compensated structures (zero net moment) with pulsed magnetic fields, where the antiparallel alignment is largely preserved during reversal. By using component ferromagnets with different magnetocrystalline and shape anisotropies, we show that it is possible to select the final magnetic state of the synthetic antiferromagnet with pulsed fields alone. Applications to magnetic memory devices are discussed.},
