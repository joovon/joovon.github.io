 abstract = {We study the frequency, linewidth, and power of spin torque driven vortex oscillators, based on a nanocontacted spin-valve (SV). The oscillation frequency strongly decreases with the contact size, and increases with the current. The power delivered by the oscillator is not quadratic with the current, in contrast with the behavior expected from the rigid vortex model (RVM). The linewidth is almost independent of the current at low current and does not strongly depend on the nanocontact size. We compare our findings with the outcomes of the RVM.},
