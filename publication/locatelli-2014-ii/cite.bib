 abstract = {We present an experimental study of phase locking in a stochastic magnetic oscillator. The system comprises a magnetic tunnel junction with a superparamagnetic free layer, whose magnetization dynamics is driven with spin torques through an external periodic driving current. We show that synchronization of this stochastic oscillator to the input current is possible for current densities below 3Ã—10$^6$ A/cm$^2$, and occurs for input frequencies lower than the natural mean frequency of the stochastic oscillator. We show that such injection locking is robust and leads to a drastic reduction in the phase diffusion of the stochastic oscillator, despite the presence of a frequency mismatch between the oscillator and the excitation.},
