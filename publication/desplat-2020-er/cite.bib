abstract = {{We compute mean waiting times between thermally activated magnetization reversals in a nanodisk with parameters similar to a free CoFeB layer used in magnetic random access memories. By combining Langerâ€™s theory and forward flux sampling simulations, we show that the Arrhenius prefactor can take values up to 1021 Hz, orders of magnitude beyond the value of 109 Hz typically assumed, and varies drastically as a function of material parameters. We show that the prefactor behaves like an exponential of the activation energy, which highlights a case of the Meyer-Neldel compensation rule. This suggests that modeling information retention times with a barrier-independent prefactor in such magnetic storage elements is not justified.}},
