 abstract = {We present a theoretical study of the influence of magnetic viscosity on current-driven domain wall dynamics. In particular we examine how domain wall depinning transitions, driven by thermal activation, are influenced by the adiabatic and nonadiabatic spin torques. We find the Arrhenius law that describes the transition rate for activation over a single energy barrier remains applicable under currents but with a current-dependent barrier height. We show that the effective energy barrier is dominated by a linear current dependence under usual experimental conditions, with a variation that depends only on the nonadiabatic spin-torque coefficient $Î²$.},
