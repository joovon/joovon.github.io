 abstract = {We present an experimental and theoretical study of the low-field dynamics of current-driven vortex oscillations in nanocontacts based on spin-valve multilayers. These oscillations appear as low-frequency (250–500 MHz) excitations in the electrical power spectrum which arise from variations in the giant magnetoresistance. We show that the vortex oscillations, once nucleated at large fields applied perpendicular to the film plane, persist at zero applied magnetic fields. Some training effects on the oscillation frequency and linewidth are also observed for small in-plane magnetic fields.},
