 abstract = {Spin-transfer torques in magnetic heterostructures give rise to a number of dynamical processes that are not accessible with magnetic fields alone. A prominent example involves self-sustained magnetization oscillations, which are made possible through the compensation of magnetic damping by the transfer of spin angular momentum from a spin-polarized current. In this contribution, the theoretical aspects of magnetization oscillations driven by spin torques, such as spin waves and vortex gyration, are presented in detail and key experimental results are highlighted. It is shown how simple but useful models can be derived from fundamental theories of magnetization dynamics and used to describe a variety of stochastic and nonlinear phenomena.},
