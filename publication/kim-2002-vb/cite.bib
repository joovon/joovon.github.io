 abstract = {We explore the magnetic heat capacity in exchange-biased ferromagnet/antiferromagnet bilayers theoretically. We show that changes in the antiferromagnetic structure due to the reversal of the ferromagnet layer can be detected by distinct features in the heat capacity. This offers a method for probing antiferromagnetic domains in exchange-biased systems.},
