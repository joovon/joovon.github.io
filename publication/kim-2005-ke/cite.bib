 abstract = {The presence of magnetic impurities in the antiferromagnet can account for some ferromagnetic hysteresis behavior observed in exchange bias systems. We show theoretically that such impurities can modify domain-wall formation in the antiferromagnet, which under certain conditions can give rise to coercivity enhancement and asymmetric hysteresis. The linear dynamics of the ferromagnet/antiferromagnet structure in the presence of impurities is also presented.},
