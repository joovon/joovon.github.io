 abstract = {We study spin-torque induced oscillations of MgO magnetic tunnel junctions in the time domain. By using the Hilbert transform on the time traces, we obtain for the first time a direct experimental measure of the coupling between the power and the phase fluctuations. We deduce the power restoration rate and we obtain low values for the coupling strength, which is consistent with the weak frequency dependence on the applied voltage.},
