 abstract = {An improved broadband inductive technique for the measurement of magnetization dynamics in thin ferromagnetic films is presented. The technique is demonstrated using thick Permalloy films, and allows for time and frequency domain measurements to be made in parallel. Free oscillations after short duration pulses  and broadband response to radio frequency fields up to  have been observed, and can be precisely matched to existing theories. This opens the way for detailed studies of the relaxation mechanisms above.},
