 abstract = {Calculations are presented showing how exchange bias in antiferromagnet/ferromagnet bilayers can be modified by interface roughness. Effects of steps and line defects are explored for compensated and uncompensated antiferromagnetic interfaces. The angular dependence of the bias field on orientation and interface structure is calculated, and thermal effects related to stability are discussed.},
