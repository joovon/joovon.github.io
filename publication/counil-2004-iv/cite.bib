 abstract = {The high-frequency magnetic response of Permalloy thin films have been measured using network-analyzer ferromagnetic resonance. We demonstrate that the excitation of spin waves by the coplanar wave-guide modify the magnetic response appreciably, in particular, by causing a frequency shift and broadening of the resonance peak. An analytic theory is presented to account for the experimental observations and provides a quantitative tool to accurately determine the Gilbert damping constant.},
