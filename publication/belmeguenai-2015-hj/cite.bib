Pt/Co/AlOx/Pt ultrathin films with varying Co thicknesses (0.6–1.2 nm) have been studied with Brillouin light spectroscopy in the Damon-Eshbach geometry. The measurements reveal a pronounced nonreciprocal propagation, which increases with decreasing Co thickness. This nonreciprocity, attributed to an interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), is significantly stronger than asymmetries resulting from surface anisotropies for such modes. Results are consistent with an interfacial DMI constant Ds=\textminus1.7\textpm0.11pJ/m, which favors left-handed chiral spin structures. This suggests that such films below 1 nm in thickness should support chiral states such as skyrmions at room temperature.},
